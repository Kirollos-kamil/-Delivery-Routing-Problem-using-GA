This project is a part of Smart Systems course showcasing GA implementation to solve the delivery routing problem.

Overview This project is an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Delivery Routing Problem, a classic optimization challenge in logistics and supply chain management. The goal is to find the most efficient routes for delivering goods to multiple destinations while minimizing cost, distance, or time. The project also utilizes visualization libraries to provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's progress and the final solution.

Problem Description: The Delivery Routing Problem involves: A set of delivery locations (including a depot where the delivery vehicle starts and ends). Constraints such as vehicle capacity, time windows, or distance limits. An objective to minimize the total distance traveled or the total cost incurred. The Genetic Algorithm is used to evolve a population of potential solutions (routes) over multiple generations, optimizing the objective function.

Key Features: Genetic Algorithm Implementation: Population initialization. Fitness evaluation. Selection, crossover, and mutation operations. Evolution over generations to find the optimal solution.

Visualization: Interactive plots to visualize the evolution of routes. Final route visualization using libraries like matplotlib or plotly.

Customizable Parameters: Population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations. Ability to define custom delivery locations, vehicle capacity, and other constraints.

Dependencies: Python 3.x numpy for numerical operations. matplotlib or plotly for visualization. itertools for efficient iteration and combinatorial operations.

Contributing: Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
