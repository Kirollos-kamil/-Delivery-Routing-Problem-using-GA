This project is part of a Smart Systems course, demonstrating the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to solve the Delivery Routing Problem â€“ a classic optimization challenge in logistics and supply chain management. The primary objective is to identify the most efficient delivery routes while minimizing total distance, time, or cost. This implementation highlights the power of evolutionary algorithms in addressing complex, real-world routing problems.

Problem Description:The Delivery Routing Problem involves optimizing the path of a delivery vehicle that starts and ends at a central depot, visiting multiple delivery locations while adhering to constraints such as:

Vehicle capacity

Delivery time windows

Maximum travel distanceThe GA approach aims to evolve a population of potential routes over successive generations, progressively refining solutions based on a defined fitness function.

Key Features:

Genetic Algorithm Core:

Population Initialization

Fitness Evaluation

Selection, Crossover, and Mutation

Multi-generational Evolution for Optimal Route Discovery

Visualization:

Real-time route evolution visualization using libraries like matplotlib or plotly.

Final route display for intuitive performance assessment.

Customizable Parameters:

Configurable population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations.

Support for custom delivery locations, vehicle capacity, and route constraints.

Technical Stack:

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib / plotly: For data visualization.

itertools: For efficient iteration and combinatorial operations.

Future Enhancements:

Adaptive Genetic Operators: Implement dynamic mutation and crossover rates based on algorithm performance.

Multi-Objective Optimization: Extend the GA to optimize for multiple criteria simultaneously, such as minimizing both distance and delivery time.

Scalability Improvements: Optimize the algorithm for larger datasets and real-time applications.
